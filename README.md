## Analyze artwork using GPT Vision and LLM

Art Analyzer is an app that uses GPT Vision (See:Â [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)) to identify artwork from images and AI language models like GPT-4 to provide detailed critiques of paintings, drawings, and other visual art forms. Users can upload an image of a piece for review, and the app will generate an analysis of the artwork covering composition, use of color, brushwork/texture, emotional impact, originality/creativity, and recommendations of similar artists and paintings.

Can we really use AI as an art critic or expert? Yes and No. This app is a fun experiment to see how far along GPT Vision has come, and the results are generally very good and surprisingly detailed. But, if you are looking to analyze and critique artwork in a more official capacity feel free to defer to art historians, experts, and enthusiasts.
